-Hope it helps whoever is trying to read this code.
-Basically what we have here is a very, very simple payroll system, obviously made in java(as you can see)
-The main idea here is that as the days go by, each object of the Employee class will get its FinalPayment attribute increased
(or it won't change at all). Aiming for this we have the calculate method, that increases FinalPayment based on the attribute
BasePayment, which it can be how many does the employee receive per hour or per sale, as examples. When the payRoll method is
called, and it takes the FinalPayment and decreases is according to syndical taxes.
-The other methods are really self explanatory(at least I hope they are, and we didn't use more than a single class to 
represent the employees, because there wasn't much necessity for it. At first sight, creating different classes seemed to be
the better way to do this system, but as we went along it started to feel a bit like overkill.
